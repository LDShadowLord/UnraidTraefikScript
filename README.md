# UnraidTraefikPlugin

A script designed to be used in conjunction with Traefik & Unraid.
Generates HTML table objects to be dynamically inserted into Unraid Docker pages to enable Traefik functionality.
This project is not affiliated with either Traefik or Unraid.

## How It Works
Create a *config.json* file similar to the *example.json* file.
Open main.py (Python 3.8, Earlier not Supported)
It will create an *index.html* page that will let you generate a bookmarklet

## Roadmap
* Create a Tool to generate the *config.json* file based off user inputs
* Add additional Node files

## Expandability
Don't see what you need here?
Create your own Node file and set up a PR to merge them.
Read *DOCS/development.md* for how to do this.
